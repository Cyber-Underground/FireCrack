# How does it work? 
Firebase has made an shitty system wich does that when u first time create a database it will ask with small and long text that "This is a test database click settings to change that or click X to..." And ofc no one fucking reads that little print of shit and just clicks X and the text never comes back and fun thing is that all test databases are public to the internet long as you have the URL. Don't ask me why. Also sorry for bad english! I hope you understand what i meant.
